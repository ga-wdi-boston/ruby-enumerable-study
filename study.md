# Ruby Enumerable Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [Enumerable definition at google](https://www.google.com/#q=enumerable+definition)
-   [Ruby Array Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html)
-   [Ruby Enumerable Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html)
-   [List ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_%28abstract_data_type%29)

Please read:
- The google definition of enumerable
- The _description_ of the Ruby
Array Class (the part before [Creating
Arrays](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html#class-Array-label-Creating+Arrays))
- The _description_ of the Ruby Enumerable Module (the part before **Public
Instance Methods**)
- The _overview_ of the List ADT at Wikipedia (the part
before the Contents block)
- The list of method names
in the **Methods** block on the left side of [Ruby Array
Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html) and [Ruby Enumerable
Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html).
  - Note that Enumerable
is listed as an **Included Module** for Array.

## Methods on Array and Enumerable

List at least two instance method names (other than `count`) that Array and
Enumerable share. An included module provides behavior to instances of the
including class. Why might Array redefine methods included from Enumerable?
Please give reasons for the methods you list.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
Some methods that Array and Enumerable share are the find_index and first methods.
I think the reason why Array might redefine methods is because of the data structure.
Arrays are just a list of values as opposed to ranges and hashes.
```

## Array#length versus Enumerable#count

Although both Array and Enumerable have a `count` method, Array also defines the
method `length`.  Why is `length` sensibly defined on Array but not Enumerable?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
The length method's functionality is specifically to just count the number of elements in
an array. The count method also does that and more depending on what we write in our block code.
Examples include counting the number of repititions for a certain value and the frequency of odd and/or even numbers.
The key difference though is that the length method is used specifically for an array structured data while
count allows for more flexibility(hashes).
```

## Compare Enumerable to Stream

Please read the Wikipedia entry for
[Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_%28computing%29).  How are streams
like enumerables?  How are they different?  Please compare and contrast these
types.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
Streams and enumerables are similar in that they are both lists of data elements. The way in which they differ is that Streams can potentially have unlimited data whereas enumerables do not
```
