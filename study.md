# Ruby Enumerable Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [Enumerable definition at google](https://www.google.com/#q=enumerable+definition)
-   [Ruby Array Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html)
-   [Ruby Enumerable Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html)
-   [List ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_%28abstract_data_type%29)

Please read:
- The google definition of enumerable
- The _description_ of the Ruby
Array Class (the part before [Creating
Arrays](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html#class-Array-label-Creating+Arrays))
- The _description_ of the Ruby Enumerable Module (the part before **Public
Instance Methods**)
- The _overview_ of the List ADT at Wikipedia (the part
before the Contents block)
- The list of method names
in the **Methods** block on the left side of [Ruby Array
Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html) and [Ruby Enumerable
Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html).
  - Note that Enumerable
is listed as an **Included Module** for Array.

## Methods on Array and Enumerable

List at least two instance method names (other than `count`) that Array and
Enumerable share. An included module provides behavior to instances of the
including class. Why might Array redefine methods included from Enumerable?
Please give reasons for the methods you list.

```md
They both share each_index and any. Arrays and Enumerables are both list objects. So they share certain fundamental characteristics such as being a container for one to many objects/values. As list objects, there is a need to traverse this range. However, enumerables have the added constraint of their values have to be sortable and unique within the range. Since arrays do not, certain enumerable methods would have to be redefined to accommodate the non-uniqueness and the non-sortable values.
```

## Array#length versus Enumerable#count

Although both Array and Enumerable have a `count` method, Array also defines the
method `length`.  Why is `length` sensibly defined on Array but not Enumerable?

```md
According to stack overflow, Ruby is designed to store arrays as a set length. Ruby does not for enumerables (I don't entire understand the explanation for that). Ruby just handles enumerables differently. I think conceptually, enumerables don't typically have to have their space defined up front, but arrays do.
```

## Compare Enumerable to Stream

Please read the Wikipedia entry for
[Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_%28computing%29).  How are streams
like enumerables?  How are they different?  Please compare and contrast these
types.

```md
Streams are like enumerables in that both don't have an end to their data. However, streams seem to be ordered only by sequence of input activity. Enumerables can have sort patters determined by the user.
```
