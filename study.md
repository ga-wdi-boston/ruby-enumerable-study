# Ruby Enumerable Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [Enumerable definition at google](https://www.google.com/#q=enumerable+definition)
-   [Ruby Array Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html)
-   [Ruby Enumerable Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html)
-   [List ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_%28abstract_data_type%29)

Please read:
- The google definition of enumerable
- The _description_ of the Ruby
Array Class (the part before [Creating
Arrays](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html#class-Array-label-Creating+Arrays))
- The _description_ of the Ruby Enumerable Module (the part before **Public
Instance Methods**)
- The _overview_ of the List ADT at Wikipedia (the part
before the Contents block)
- The list of method names
in the **Methods** block on the left side of [Ruby Array
Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html) and [Ruby Enumerable
Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html).
  - Note that Enumerable
is listed as an **Included Module** for Array.

## Methods on Array and Enumerable

List at least two instance method names (other than `count`) that Array and
Enumerable share. An included module provides behavior to instances of the
including class. Why might Array redefine methods included from Enumerable?
Please give reasons for the methods you list.

```md
One method is map.  The map method in the enumerable points to the cat method to
take an element and create an array populated with the object's length's worth of numbers.
In array, it includes map_with_index, since arrays are index based and other enumerables
may not be.

A second method is the slice method.  The array slice method is based on indexes.
However, enumerator slice is based on patterns before or after the passed block.
```

## Array#length versus Enumerable#count

Although both Array and Enumerable have a `count` method, Array also defines the
method `length`.  Why is `length` sensibly defined on Array but not Enumerable?

```md
Array length is the number of populated indices in the array.  Count gives the
index and place of a passed object or block.  Length is not used in enumerable because
not all enumerable objects are length based.
```

## Compare Enumerable to Stream

Please read the Wikipedia entry for
[Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_%28computing%29).  How are streams
like enumerables?  How are they different?  Please compare and contrast these
types.

```md
Streams are like enumerables in that they can be iterated over and look like data
grouped together.  They are different in that streams can be inifite and are not necessarily formal
data structures while enumerables tend to be arrays, objects or hashes.
```
