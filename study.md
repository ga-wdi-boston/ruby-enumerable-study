# Ruby Enumerable Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [Enumerable definition at google](https://www.google.com/#q=enumerable+definition)
-   [Ruby Array Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html)
-   [Ruby Enumerable Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html)
-   [List ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_%28abstract_data_type%29)

Please read the google definition of enumerable, the _description_ of the Ruby
Array Class (the part before [Creating
Arrays](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html#class-Array-label-Creating+Arrays)),
the _description_ of the Ruby Enumerable Module (the part before **Public
Instance Methods**), and the _overview_ of the List ADT at Wikipedia (the part
before the Contents block).  Also, please read through the list of method names
in the **Methods** block on the left side of [Ruby Array
Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html) and [Ruby Enumerable
Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html).  Note that Enumerable
is listed as an **Included Module** for Array.

## Methods on Array and Enumerable

List at least two instance method names (other than `count`) that Array and
Enumerable share. An included module provides behavior to instances of the
including class. Why might Array redefine methods included from Enumerable?
Please give reasons for the methods you list.

```md
map and sort are defined on both. I think that the reason for being defined differently on enumerables is because enumerables are a mixin, meaning they contribute methods to a number of classes, whereas an array might generally need a more specific application of that method.

Map and sort seem to fit this definition, where the method needed on arrays is probably simpler than the generic one used by Enumerables.
```

## Array#length versus Enumerable#count

Although both Array and Enumerable have a `count` method, Array also defines the
method `length`.  Why is `length` sensibly defined on Array but not Enumerable?

```md
I'm not sure, but I believe it is because an enumerable is in a sense defined by its length. That is to say, an enumberable will always be a specificed set of numbers, whereas an array can be and arbitrary list of things, which may increase of decrease due to invocation of other methods.
```

## Compare Enumerable to Stream

Please read the Wikipedia entry for
[Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_%28computing%29).  How are streams
like enumerables?  How are they different?  Please compare and contrast these
types.

```md
Where enumberables contain a finite number of data points, streams are effectively infinite, and will keep sending information to be processed indefinitely.
```
