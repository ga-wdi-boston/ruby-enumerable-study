# Ruby Enumerable Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Required Readings

-   [Enumerable definition at google](https://www.google.com/#q=enumerable+definition)
-   [Ruby Array Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html)
-   [Ruby Enumerable Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html)
-   [List ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_%28abstract_data_type%29)

Please read:
- The google definition of enumerable
- The _description_ of the Ruby
Array Class (the part before [Creating
Arrays](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html#class-Array-label-Creating+Arrays))
- The _description_ of the Ruby Enumerable Module (the part before **Public
Instance Methods**)
- The _overview_ of the List ADT at Wikipedia (the part
before the Contents block)
- The list of method names
in the **Methods** block on the left side of [Ruby Array
Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html) and [Ruby Enumerable
Module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html).
  - Note that Enumerable
is listed as an **Included Module** for Array.

## Methods on Array and Enumerable

List at least two instance method names (other than `count`) that Array and
Enumerable share. An included module provides behavior to instances of the
including class. Why might Array redefine methods included from Enumerable?
Please give reasons for the methods you list.

```md
first   - the first item of a collection could be different from the
first item of an array.  if you had a collection of colors, which one would you want to return first?  maybe you want an ordering of ROYGBV

sort - both have a sort method.

okay the more i'm thinking about this the more confused i am getting.
```

## Array#length versus Enumerable#count

Although both Array and Enumerable have a `count` method, Array also defines the
method `length`.  Why is `length` sensibly defined on Array but not Enumerable?

```md
the concept of length in an array makes sense - for an array, the length of it will tell you how many items are in the array.  items can be duplicated in an array.

an enumerable is a collection of items - for example, a set of colors.  it is more appropriate to talk about how many are in the collection than its length.
```

## Compare Enumerable to Stream

Please read the Wikipedia entry for
[Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_%28computing%29).  How are streams
like enumerables?  How are they different?  Please compare and contrast these
types.

```md
i would say they are similar in that for each elemnt in the enumerable or the stream, you don't know what you are going to get.  it's just a bunch of elements.  that's what an enumerable is too

they are different because...i would say there can be duplicates in a stream - that is something you don't want in an enumberable.
```
